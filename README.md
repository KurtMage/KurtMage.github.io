# How to set up for OBS
## 1. Choose a layout from the list below. Copy the link for the layout you want.
NOTE: Every URL below has `p=1` in it. This is what determines what player your controller is, and you can change it. For example, if the controller that you want to visualize is player 3, you would change this to `p=3`.
## 2. In OBS, click the + in sources to add a source. Select Browser as the type.
## 3. In the URL box, put the URL from step 1.
## 4. Change the Width to 1500.
## 5. It's all set up! 
Note: you need to give it an input from the controller for it to show up.
